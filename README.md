4. *Encourage more reviews* for under-reviewed products to increase engagement and transparency.  
5. Align pricing strategy with *customer feedback and demand* for sustainable revenue growth.

## Limitations  

- The dataset is relatively small (1,465 records) and may not represent all product trends.  
- *Review content (text)* was not analyzed due to Excel’s limitations in handling unstructured data.  
- No *temporal insights* (e.g., trends over time) were possible due to lack of date columns.
